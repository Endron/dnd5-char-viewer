# dnd5-char-viewer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Endron/dnd5-char-viewer.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Endron/dnd5-char-viewer)
Tool to view Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition characters. 

The tool will enable viewing the character sheet of your character in your web browser on your desktop PC or on your 
mobile device. This will make it inherently more useful than a character sheet app on your mobile. As the character
data is delivered via a REST API you could even implement your own viewing frontend.
The viewer already comes with a frontend build using Angular Material. While this does not provide a very DnD like look
it will integrate nicely with modern mobile and desktop UIs.
